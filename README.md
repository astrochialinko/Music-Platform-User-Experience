# Music Platform User Experience
- MATH/STAT 571B Final Project (Spring 2025)
- Authors: Mushaer Ahmed, Chia-Lin Ko, Aiqing Li, Winston Zeng

## Goals
This project aims to conduct an experiment evaluating which music platform provides the best user experience in the free version (containing ads).

The comparison will be based on two response variables:
- **Ad Count**: the total number of advertisements heard per hour of listening.
- **Music Inventory Satisfaction**: User rating on a subjective 1-10 scale evaluating how satisfied the listener is with the platformâ€™s music inventory.
